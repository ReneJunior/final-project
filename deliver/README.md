# Deliver
In this folder is the final article and the reproducible file. The reproducible article was created using the software Jupyter Notebook, so it has the extension ".ipynb", called [Reproduction_procedures.ipynb](https://github.com/ReneJunior/final-project/blob/master/deliver/Reproduction_procedures.ipynb). In the file [Paper_code.ipynb](https://github.com/ReneJunior/final-project/blob/master/deliver/Paper_code.ipynb) is the experiments with two methodologies. It is also possible to find the final version of the article, in pdf, with the name of [Paper.pdf](https://github.com/ReneJunior/final-project/blob/master/deliver/Paper.pdf). To make this article, the zip file [Paper_in_Latex.zip](https://github.com/ReneJunior/final-project/blob/master/deliver/Paper_in_Latex.zip) was used, with the aid of a latex compiler, [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/login).
