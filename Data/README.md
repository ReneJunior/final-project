# Data
In this folder is found the system data used to perform the tests for this work. The original versions of this work can be found at [IEEE14](https://labs.ece.uw.edu/pstca/pf14/pg_tca14bus.htm) and [Macedo](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7095593?denied=).

The file named "[System_IEEE_14bus_branch.txt](https://github.com/ReneJunior/final-project/blob/master/Data/System_IEEE_14bus_branch.txt)" presents the data of the system branches, with the physical characteristics of the line, such as resistance, impedance and shunting capacitors. The files "[PC.txt](https://github.com/ReneJunior/final-project/blob/master/Data/PC.txt)" and "[QC.txt](https://github.com/ReneJunior/final-project/blob/master/Data/QC.txt)", present the collected data, of the demand of the system bars. The file "[System_IEEE_14bus_node.txt](https://github.com/ReneJunior/final-project/blob/master/Data/System_IEEE_14bus_node.txt)" shows the data of the bars, indicating which will be the reference bar, load bars and generators.
