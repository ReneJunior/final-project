# Versions and codes
In this folder it is possible to find the history of the codes and documentation of the paper. It is possible to find all the explained equations, associated with an initial version of this work, in [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wPIykUu6MUhz7HeYoesajYlYKoeVE_S4?usp=sharing), but it was used the Jupyter Notebook to document the program. Initially, the codes were made separately from the document and at the end they were attached.
